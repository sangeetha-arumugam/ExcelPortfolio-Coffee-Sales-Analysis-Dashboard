## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to enhance the coffee shop's analytical capabilities by offering insights into customer behavior and sales patterns. It involves cleaning and preparing a coffee sales dataset along with customer and product data to create a comprehensive order table using Excel formulas. 
## Objective
The objective is to analyze the data through various pivot tables and charts, culminating in an interactive Excel dashboard that provides valuable insights into coffee sales and customer behavior. This will support optimized management improvement and improved decision-making in sales.
## Task
1. Data collection, cleaning, and preparation
   
2. Create an order table using Excel formulas such as VLOOKUP, INDEX, and IF.
 
3. Analyse sales patterns by Coffee Type and by Country with PivotTables.
   
4. Determine high-performing Coffee Type Over Time.
 
5. Develop compelling reports and visualization
    
6. Create an Interactive dashboard
